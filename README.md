# Adrian Evans Bio Page

## Introduction
**Adrian Evans Bio Page** is a Responsive Website. It was made using Bootstrap which is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. In addition to Bootstrap the website also makes use of Google fonts to style fonts and there were also some custom styling applied.

It was designed to display **Adrian Evans's** ability as a website designer/coder and also provide potential customers with means to contact or follow his work.

The Site consists of 3 pages:
1. About Page 
2. Contact Page
3. Portfolio Page

Each Page has the following:
1. NavBar that is responsive to screensizes that are lg and xl _vs_ smaller screen sizes. 
2. Content Section that is responsive to various screensizes.

The website HTML was also validated using validator.w3.org.
